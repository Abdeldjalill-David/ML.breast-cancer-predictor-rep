ðŸŽ€ Breast Cancer Prediction and Detection Model ðŸ©º
author: ABDELDJALIL_DAVID_KHALDI 
ðŸŒ¸ Overview
In honor of Pink October, this project focuses on early breast cancer detection using a Logistic Regression model. Leveraging the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset, our model predicts whether tumors are benign or malignant, aiming to support timely medical decisions and contribute to the fight against breast cancer.

ðŸš€ Features
Interactive Jupyter Notebook: Input medical data to receive tumor predictions.
Current Accuracy: Achieves 65% accuracy with plans for future improvements.
Simple & User-Friendly: Designed for easy use by healthcare professionals and researchers.
ðŸ“ˆ How It Works
Input Data: Enter patient data such as tumor size and texture.
Prediction: The model classifies the tumor as benign or malignant.
Actionable Insights: Use the predictions to guide further medical evaluations.
ðŸ”§ Installation
